## Overview ##

My name is Matthew Burr and I am an IT consultant and contractor in the Greater Toronto Area.

I have over 14 years of experience specializing in network and systems administration, as well as network security and network architecture. I have worked in various industries in my career including government, social media, manufacturing, non-profits, software development, retail and financial services.

I have also volunteered with various non-profit organizations in the GTA, both in IT and non-IT roles.

I also provide independent consulting and contracting services. I own and operate [Ten Fifteen Solutions](https://tenfifteen.ca), which is my IT consulting and contracting business that I have been running since early 2016. I provide various services, including:

* Cloud Migrations and Hybrid Cloud Deployments
* Network Auditing
* Network Design and Implementation
* Network Security Consultation
* Project Implementation
* Systems Administration
* Technical Writing

I am certified in various technologies, including Cisco, Microsoft, Palo Alto Networks and VMware.

## Education ##

I attended [Cambrian College of Applied Arts and Technology](https://cambriancollege.ca/) in Sudbury, Ontario from September 2006 to May 2009 where I received a diploma in Computer Systems Technology. I picked this particular institution because of the high rating of the program at the time, and the fact that many of the instructors worked directly for Cisco and Microsoft. I also liked Sudbury and Northern Ontario in general, which was an appealing aspect of choosing that institution over others that were closer to home.

I look back fondly of my time at Cambrian College, I thank all of my success to the excellent instructors and resources that I had while I was there.

At the end of my time at Cambrian College I was chosen to represent Cambrian College at the [Skills Ontario Competition](http://www.skillsontario.com/) in Waterloo, Ontario for IT and Networking Skills competition on May 5, 2009. I ended up winning first place in that category for that year. Several weeks later I went to the [Skills Canada Competition](https://www.skillscompetencescanada.com/) in Charlottetown, PEI for the IT and Networking Skills competition on May 21, 2009, and also got first place in that category as well.

I strongly believe in this competition and what it stands for, and I have even volunteered as a judge for that competition in May 2018, 2019 and 2021 at the Skills Ontario Competition in Toronto, Ontario.

## Experience ##

I mainly support Palo Alto Firewalls, Cisco Devices (Switches/Routers/Firewalls), AWS/Azure and virtually all Microsoft technologies. I have a great deal of experience with network design and implementation, and I have successfully deployed and supported complex networking solutions for several companies.

As I have told employers in the past, I am not a developer. Even though I have a very good understanding of several programming languages (C, C++, C# and Java), I do not program for a living. I prefer the networking and systems administration side of IT and I only program as a hobby. I take those skills and I am able to apply it to the DevOps philosophy that has become so popular and necessary in the last few years.

## Publications ##

I have released several publications over the last few years, all of which can be found on the [Publications](/publications/) page. Some of these publications are available for free, and some are available for purchase. All publications that I have released are available on [Gumroad](https://mjcb.gumroad.com/) and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/author/matthewburr/), and those are the only two platforms that I use to release content on. If you find any of my publications elsewhere, please [contact](#contact) me.

## Daily Drivers ##

I am currently using the following equipment for my daily personal usage:

* Apple MacBook Air (M1, 2020)
* Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max
* Dell Inspiron 14 2-in-1 (7435)

I also have an HP EliteDesk 600 G3 Mini (Intel Core i5-7500T, 32 GB RAM, Windows Server 2022) that I use for running virtual machines on Hyper-V, and that is only for testing purposes. I run all of my important virtual machines in Azure, I don't run anything locally.

VS Code is my text editor of choice, and as the IDE for all projects that I do. Most of my daily workflow uses VS Code in some capacity, usually with GitHub involved.

Even though I don't like to keep old things, I collect a few old laptops including several IBM ThinkPads and other legacy devices. I have also been getting into the whole retro computing craze and revisiting a lot of the computers I used when I was a kid, including the Commodore 64 and early DOS machines.

## Website Technology Stack ##

This website was previously hosted on [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/) up until the end of 2021 and was moved to a different [platform and hosting provider](/blog/2021/12/23/goodbye-wordpress-hello-hugo/). Currently, this website is using the following platforms for content management and hosting:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - For hosting the website's Git repository.
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - For content management and static HTML generation.
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - For website hosting and DNS.

I am using the [Hugo Clarity](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity) theme with very minor modifications.

## Personal ##

I was born and raised in Lindsay, Ontario. I have lived and worked in the Greater Toronto Area since 2010.

I made a decision several years ago to not use social media. I deleted my Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts in early 2018, and I have no plan on ever using those platforms again. I do not like the way that social media propagates false information and I do not want to participate in those platforms as a result of that.

## Why Did I Create This Website? ##

I created this website for a few reasons, mostly because I haven't had a significant web presence in a long time. I actually had a blog back in the early 2000's, but I never put a lot of effort into it at the time and it ended up being lost to the web (I actually don't even remember where it was hosted or what the address was). I wanted a permanent presence on the web that was completely under my control where I could showcase that I am currently working on, share my thoughts on certain topics, and share things that I find interesting.

I may use this website to showcase things that I have created and may be for sale, but that will be on a specific basis and I will always be upfront about that.

I will never have any third-party advertisements on this website. Advertisements suck, and I only created this website because I wanted to, and I never intended to use advertisements to profit from it. I have moved this website to a free hosting provider since launching it back in 2018, so I don't exactly need to recoup any costs associated with the website since the costs are zero.

I also don't allow for public comments to be posted on this website. I don't have the time or energy to moderate those comments and I already get several dozen spam messages a day, so I don't want to take the time to moderate those. If someone really needs to get a hold of me, it is not difficult to do.
