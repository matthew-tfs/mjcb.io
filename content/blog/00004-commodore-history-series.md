summary: "The 8-Bit Guy has been working on a fairly comprehensive history and review of the Commodore Computer family starting from the Commodore PET, to the Commodore 64, all the way to the Commodore C128. I admit that I am complete nerd and I find this entire video series very interesting, mostly because for a brief time when I was a child I had a Commodore 64 and it was technically the first computer that I ever owned."

[The 8-Bit Guy](https://www.youtube.com/c/The8BitGuy) has been working on a fairly comprehensive history and review of the Commodore Computer family starting from the Commodore PET, to the Commodore 64, all the way to the Commodore C128. I admit that I am complete nerd and I find this entire video series very interesting. This is mostly because for a brief time when I was a kid I had a Commodore 64, and it was technically the first computer that I ever owned.

In parts 4 and 5 of the series, he even has one of the engineers ([Bil Herd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bil_Herd)) that actually worked at Commodore, give his input and insight to the design of some of the systems.

I will update this post occasionally as this particular series is a work in progress, and The 8-Bit Guy is continually adding to it.
