## 2018 in General ##

When I decided that I actually wanted to start a dedicated website/blog earlier in 2018, I intended to use it as a way to showcase what I was working on and what I have accomplished overall. I find that I work through a lot of problems and I never share the solutions with people, which is one of the main reasons that I wanted to create this site. I also wanted to use this site as a way to show what I was interested in with subjects other than IT, which I ended up not doing (even though I had several ideas, I never posted anything). I ended up not posting as often as I wanted to, but that will be something that I intend to change in 2019.

Something not related to this site, but something that I did that is sort of related (I guess) in 2018 is that I have deleted all of my social media accounts. It was a bit of a pain at first, but I have deleted my Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts. I also stopped using WhatsApp entirely due to their ownership by Facebook. I will spend the next few months reviewing what other sites and services that I am using on a daily basis and see if I am going to stop using them as well. I have also gone through all of the permissions on my Google accounts and I have even started restricting my usage of Google services.

I have started using a VPN service for some purposes (I would prefer not to say which service I ended up going with, but there are a lot to choose from) and I have started using alternative search engines other than Google for my daily usage. I ended up setting DuckDuckGo as my default for all of my devices. I find that it doesn't do as good of a job as Google in some cases and is better in others, but overall it is good enough for my needs.

## 2019 Goals ##

I definitely want to finish a lot of the things that I have been working on. I have a list of side projects that I have been working and I want to work on, and I want to get completed by this time next year. If not, I at least want to have gone through everything and see where I am with it and see if it is worth pursuing.

Professionally, I want to continue my work with my side company ([Ten Fifteen Solutions](https://tenfifteen.ca/)) and make a few changes to it. I also want to update a few of my certifications and get a few new ones in 2019 if possible.

I am looking forward to 2019 and I am looking forward to using this site more often. On a side note, Gutenberg is fine, I have no idea what the big issue is.
