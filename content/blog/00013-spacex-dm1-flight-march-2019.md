The SpaceX Demonstration Mission 1 Flight has successfully completed as of 8:45 EST on Friday March 8, 2019. There were no issues and this is the very successful first step towards the next flight (In-Flight Abort Test) that will take place in the next few weeks, using the same Dragon Capsule that completed the DM1 Mission. If nothing major comes up, the DM2 flight should occur in the Summer of 2019 with two Astronauts on board.

Everything went perfectly and the Astronauts on-board the ISS were having some fun with the Zero Gravity Indicator that SpaceX left in the Dragon Capsule:

I have been following the development of the Dragon Crew Capsule and all of the changes that SpaceX has put into the Falcon 9 rocket to get to this point. I'm also looking forward to the next Falcon Heavy launches and the Raptor hop tests this Spring. 2019 is definitely going to be an interesting year in Space Flight.
