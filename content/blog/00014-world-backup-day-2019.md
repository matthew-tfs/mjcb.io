World Backup Day takes place every year on March 31st, but it is never a bad time to talk about backups and why they should be important to you. Unfortunately for most people, backing up their data is a pretty major afterthought and most people never even think about it. Backups are easier to do than ever to do with technologies such as OneDrive, Google Drive and iCloud. The amount of effort that used to be required to backup your data has dropped considerably in the last few years. There is pretty much no excuse to not make sure your data is protected in 2019.

For a few years my backup routine would consist of multiple external hard drives (all encrypted) that I would leave at home and off-site somewhere. I would cycle these devices monthly in order to make sure my data was safe. As time went on this became a major hassle, but I still keep at least one physical copy readily available. Storing data online is safe and cheap, so it is definitely something that you should take advantage of.

Losing your personal files due to a hardware failure or through malware is one thing, but I have had to tell businesses in the past that they had lost years of data due to bad or incomplete backups. Remember, if you have not tested your backups, do not consider them to be backups.

I won't say too much more about this, to learn more about this initiative you should take time to visit the World Backup Day website at [http://www.worldbackupday.com](http://www.worldbackupday.com).
