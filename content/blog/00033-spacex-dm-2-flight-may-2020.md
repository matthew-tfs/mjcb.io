It took 10 years from the beginning of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, but SpaceX finally did it, they finally launched Astronauts on the world's first privately built spacecraft and rocket (after a few days delay due to weather). I don't have a whole lot to say about it, I am just glad that SpaceX finally pulled it off.

Launch starts around the 4 hour and 23 minute mark in the video.
