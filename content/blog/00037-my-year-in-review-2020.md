## 2020 in General ##

So to start off, COVID-19 just completely messed up all of my 2020 plans. This is both with my professional plans as well as my personal plans, but considering how bad it has been for others I am not going to complain. COVID-19 has been the most significant health crisis in our lifetimes, so everyone has had to make sacrifices and adjustments.

I had made several plans to work on Certifications and complete additional training, but that will have to occur later in 2021 or even 2022 once the COVID-19 vaccine is in wide circulation and those centres and events can safely restart.

I started several new projects that I did not complete entirely in 2020, but those projects should be competed in the first few months of 2021.

## This Website in Statistics ##

So 2020 turned out to be the best year ever for my website and blog. I posted the most amount of articles and I have seen the most traffic I have ever had. I didn't create this site because I cared about the number of visitors, but it is nice to see that people are actually seeing what I am working on.

There were several posts that did extremely well from a traffic perspective, but oddly enough my random post about [Windows NT 3.51 on Hyper-V](/blog/2018/09/25/windows-nt-351-hyper-v/) has had consistent traffic for some reason. I wrote that post after starting a project which I have shelved for the time being, but I guess there are some people who find it useful.

The entire [Certificate Authority in Windows Server 2019](/blog/2020/03/09/certificate-authority-windows-server-2019/) guide did extremely well and I intend to make several follow-ups to that post. I also posted two articles about using [LaTeX with Visual Studio Code](/blog/2020/01/23/visual-studio-code-with-latex/) which has also done very well. I have been using LaTeX for two major projects, and Visual Studio Code has been an extremely useful editor for that purpose.

Out of curiosity I looked at the numbers for all pages viewed in 2020 and how that would have worked for potential advertisements. Even though the numbers were good I didn't feel as though the money potential was good enough to warrant putting advertisements on the site, which I am not a fan of.

## Professional and Personal Life ##

Things went well for me considering everything else that was going on. COVID-19, the pandemic and the lockdown was definitely unexpected. Luckily I was already able to work from home so I easily made it work. It certainly made me appreciate how much I took for granted beforehand, so I am glad that I was able to get through it.

## 2021 Goals ##

I was able to complete a lot of uncompleted projects in 2020 that I planned to do and I also started some new ones that I am looking to complete this year. Not really much to say right now, but I will be posting updates as I get closer to completing those projects.
