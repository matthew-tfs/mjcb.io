I have received several emails lately from people who have purchased my [Practical Guide to PKI with Windows Server - First Edition](/publications/practical-guide-to-pki-with-windows-server-first-edition/) book and from people who have been downloaded my [free](/publications/building-a-certificate-authority-in-windows-server-2019/) guide on the same subject. There isn't a problem with this, I am glad that people are reading both publications and have questions about it, but I wanted to set expectations with people whenever they have questions about it.

I have received a lot of good feedback on both the book and the guide, as well as the original [multi-post](/blog/2020/03/09/certificate-authority-windows-server-2019/) series on the subject, and people seem to find those resources useful. I have had several good discussions over email on issues and environment issues, since PKI implementations are always different, and it isn't always a turnkey solution. I don't mind answering the odd question or two when I get a chance, but implementing a PKI is a complicated process in some cases and it is not always a quick answer. As stated, I am not responsible for issues that may arise because of following these guides and whenever I respond to questions. Since PKI implementations can be complicated, I am sometimes hesitant to give quick answers, especially when I don't have all the required information.
 
For complicated questions and requests, I do offer full consulting and contracting services through my company, [Ten Fifteen Solutions](https://tenfifteen.ca/). If you require assistance with implementing a Certificate Authority within your organization, I can certainly try and assist with that. I also offer additional services as well, such as:

* Network Design and Implementation
* Network Security Consultation
* Cloud Migrations and Hybrid Cloud Deployments
* Systems Administration
* Project Implementation
* Technical Writing

I usually get back to potential clients within 24 hours. My rates are negotiable and depending on the amount of work to be done and the type of organization, I will usually offer a flat rate. If you are having an urgent issue such as your network is down, I may not be able to help you due to timing and availability.
