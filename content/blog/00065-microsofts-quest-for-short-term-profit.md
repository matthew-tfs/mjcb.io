summary: "This article from Windows Central came up the other day and it sums up a lot of the current issues with the consumer side of Microsoft, not necessarily on the Azure or Office 365 sides. Obviously, short term gains are most publicly traded companies primary concern, but Microsoft is no longer playing the long game on its core products and services, and it is starting to erode trust in the company. Overall, a good read and worth the time to go through it."

This article from [Windows Central](https://www.windowscentral.com/) came up the other day and it sums up a lot of the current issues with the "consumer side" of Microsoft, not necessarily on the Azure or Office 365 sides. Obviously, short term gains are most publicly traded companies primary concern, but Microsoft is no longer playing the long game on its core products and services, and it is starting to erode trust in the company. Overall, a good read and worth the time to go through it.

I have been working on a similar post for a while, but mostly focusing on the baffling decisions that the Windows team has been making over the last few years on the server side of things. I will post that later this year after Windows Server 2025 is released.
