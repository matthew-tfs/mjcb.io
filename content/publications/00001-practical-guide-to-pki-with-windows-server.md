## Who Is This Book For? ##

The purpose of this book is to create a Certificate Authority using Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) with Microsoft Windows Server. This book offers a comprehensive step-by-step guide that demonstrates how to successfully create a Certificate Authority using those technologies.

This book also explains each step, the necessity of that step, and the importance of that step within the Certificate Authority. The results of this book will create a Certificate Authority that can issue certificates internally within an organization in a secure manner, using best practices.

This book is meant for developers, network administrators and systems administrators who have a basic understanding of Windows Server and Public Key Infrastructures and need to deploy a Certificate Authority rapidly within their environment for various purposes. By using the steps provided in this book, there will be a Certificate Authority framework created that can be customized for whatever requirements are needed in any environment.

This book is also meant to be used by developers, network administrators and system administrators who can interpret this guide and modify it for their existing environment. Simply following this guide will not implement a functioning PKI for your organization, you will need to modify the steps accordingly to make it function properly. This means creating different servers, modifying steps for different Active Directory domains, modifying LDAP settings, modifying file paths, creating different certificates, and other critical steps as needed.

The contents of this book are presented in a thorough, but easy to follow manner. Screenshots are provided for important steps for verification purposes and to demonstrate how the environment should be configured.
