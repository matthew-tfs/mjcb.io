I retrieved most of the results for Skills Canada from the Wayback Machine. Here are the links to each year that I was able to retrieve:

There do not appear to be any results available online for any Skills Canada competition prior to 2002.

I copied the results information into spreadsheets for each year. I used the Excel 2004 XML Spreadsheet (.xml) format because it stores information in plain text and works well with Git. It is readable with Microsoft Excel and LibreOffice Calc.
